The project goals detailed below represent a summary of the dataset - including its format and source 
location - as well as the distinct algorithms we expect to implement in our final project.  These goals 
pertain to our team for CS 225 Data Structures, composed of Hrishikesh Deshmukh, Sabar Nimmagadda, Lloyd 
Quadros, and Bobby Wang.  These project goals are relevant only to the Fall 2020 semester.

We intend on choosing the OpenFlights dataset, which contains a historical example of flight routes and 
corresponding airports from recorded data in 2014.  The expectation is that our group will process the 
OpenFlights dataset and load one or more data files - such as the flight routes - into a directed graph.  
Our code will proceed to use the graph structure to run three different algorithms of interest.  For the 
traversal algorithm we intend to select and implement BFS (Breadth First Search) because it seems like a 
logical traversal for OpenFlights.  It more useful to broadly sweep a swath of nearby nodes in the graph 
when we already have algorithms that traverse quickly from one node to the destination node.  For our covered algorithms 
we will implement a Shortest Path algorithm in order to identify efficient, quick, and preferred routes.  
Specifically, we will either employ the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm or Dijkstra’s Algorithm.  Lastly, our 
group has proposed to utilize the Landmark Path algorithm - from the complex and uncovered options - in 
order to find the shortest pathway between two points and through a distinct third location.  These 
algorithms will also help us answer the key question of how our graph weights should be calculated.  To 
add on to that, our team’s goal is to construct a thorough test bench for each of the three algorithms 
listed above and generate test cases similar to those we have seen throughout the course of this class.  
The ultimate expectation is that our final code will be functional, dynamic, and executable on the EWS 
system, only employing publicly installed libraries and the team’s code in our group repository.
