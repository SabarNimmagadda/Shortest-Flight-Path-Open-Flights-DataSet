Our team for the final project of CS 225 Data Structures, composed of Hrishikesh Deshmukh, Sabar Nimmagadda, Lloyd Quadros, and Bobby Wang, agrees to the team contract detailed below.  The contract pertains to the Fall 2020 semester.
Communication is crucial to the development of a well functioning group and an operational project.  The method and frequency of our communication will be especially significant due to the fact we will be forced to work remotely throughout the entirety of the project.  Our current plan consists of weekly meetings lasting anywhere from 20 minutes to 60 minutes, detailing what was accomplished during the week and subsequently documenting those progressions.  Additionally, this weekly meeting will be used to outline project goals for the upcoming week.  Because all four group members are located in Central Standard Time, planning for the specific day and time of the week when the meeting will take place remains a flexible procedure and is up to the discretion of all group members.  We will utilize Zoom to host our meetings, as all members of the group are familiar with this software.  Secondary options include but are not limited to Discord and Google Hangouts, in the event that Zoom is deemed unreliable.  Although no singular individual will be tasked with recording minutes during the meeting, it is expected that each group member will contribute towards the centralized “Development” document.  All teammates have each other’s contact information and the ability to email, call, or text each other regarding the project.  It is expected of each member to communicate with each other in a respectful, timely, and courteous manner.  All team members will be encouraged to express their ideas with each other during the meeting and through personal communication.  Each person will be encouraged to speak and engage with each other - discouragement and demeaning behavior will not be tolerated.
Collaboration and a fair distribution of the project’s workload will not only increase the well-being and satisfaction of each group member, but will optimize our efficiency, volume of production, and final product.  Each individual in the group will supplement multiple deliverables at varying degrees of effort based upon their unique strengths and desires, while overall commitment will remain roughly equal.  Although expertise is not expected of any one person, diligence, effort, and enthusiasm will be necessary from all four members in order to surmount the challenges presented by the final project.  The amount of work expected weekly should be approximately equal to the amount of time spent on a lab or MP each week and can vary based on the progress made towards that week’s goals.  Conflicts with time commitment availability are expected.  They will be planned for accordingly during our meetings, with the onus on the particular individual to adapt and recommend a solution to their conflict.  Additionally, any and all significant conflicts between group members including but not limited to lack of productivity or communication will be resolved during weekly meetings in a patient and attentive manner.  Only after multiple attempts to resolve the situation amongst the group will the course staff be contacted as a last resort.  We are excited to work with each other and look forward to a productive, engaging, and meaningful final project for CS 225.
